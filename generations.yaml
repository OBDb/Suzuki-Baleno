    description: "The first-generation Suzuki Baleno (also marketed as the Esteem in North America and Cultus Crescent in Japan) was positioned as a compact car sitting above the Swift in Suzuki's global lineup. Available in sedan, hatchback, and wagon body styles depending on market, the Baleno featured conservative, straightforward styling typical of Japanese cars of the era. Engine options varied significantly by market but typically included 1.3-liter, 1.6-liter, and 1.8-liter gasoline engines, with power outputs ranging from approximately 85 to 121 horsepower. Transmission options included five-speed manual and four-speed automatic, with most variants featuring front-wheel drive, though all-wheel drive was available in some markets, particularly for wagon models in Japan. The interior offered reasonable space efficiency and straightforward design, though with relatively basic materials and features by contemporary standards. This generation established the Baleno nameplate in many international markets as a practical, affordable compact car, though it didn't achieve the same level of recognition or sales success as some competitors in the segment."

    description: "After a hiatus of over a decade, Suzuki revived the Baleno nameplate for a new global hatchback positioned as a more spacious alternative to the Swift, targeting the European B-segment and similar classes in other markets. Built on Suzuki's new HEARTECT platform designed for improved efficiency and safety, the second-generation Baleno featured more contemporary styling with smooth lines, a distinctive chrome accent connecting the headlights, and an overall design focused on maximizing interior space within compact exterior dimensions. Engine options varied by market but centered around efficient small-displacement units including a 1.0-liter Boosterjet turbocharged three-cylinder producing approximately 110 horsepower, a 1.2-liter Dualjet naturally aspirated four-cylinder with approximately 90 horsepower, and in some markets, a 1.4-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder. Some variants featured mild hybrid technology with Suzuki's SHVS (Smart Hybrid Vehicle by Suzuki) system incorporating an integrated starter generator and lithium-ion battery to improve efficiency. Transmission options included five-speed manual, six-speed automatic, and CVT depending on market and engine. The interior emphasized practicality with class-leading passenger and cargo space, featuring a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system on higher trims with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Advanced safety features unusual for its segment included available autonomous emergency braking, lane departure warning, and adaptive cruise control on higher specifications. Produced primarily in India by Maruti Suzuki, the second-generation Baleno successfully established itself in various international markets as a practical, value-focused offering combining the efficiency expected of a small car with the interior space more typical of a larger vehicle."

    description: "The third-generation Suzuki Baleno, primarily developed by Maruti Suzuki in India, builds upon the strengths of its predecessor while introducing a more distinctive design and enhanced technology. Built on an updated version of Suzuki's HEARTECT platform, the new Baleno features more angular styling with a wider grille, sleeker LED headlights with distinctive daytime running light signatures, and more pronounced character lines along the body sides. Engine options vary by market but typically include a refined 1.2-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder producing approximately 90 horsepower, now with enhanced efficiency through improved dual VVT, cooled EGR, and in some variants, mild hybrid assistance through an updated version of Suzuki's SHVS system. Transmission options include five-speed manual and CVT automatic, with exclusively front-wheel drive configurations. The interior represents the most significant advancement, featuring a more premium design with an available 9-inch floating touchscreen infotainment system, a first-in-segment head-up display in some markets, and a digital instrument cluster on higher trim levels. Material quality has improved throughout with soft-touch surfaces in key areas and more attention to detail in switchgear and controls. Safety technology has expanded to include up to six airbags, electronic stability control as standard in most markets, and Suzuki's 360View camera system on premium variants. Maintaining the previous generation's focus on space efficiency, the third-generation Baleno offers generous passenger accommodations and cargo capacity relative to its exterior dimensions. This generation further refines the Baleno's positioning as a practical, technology-rich hatchback offering the interior space of a larger vehicle in a compact, efficient package, principally targeting markets in Asia, Europe, and Oceania."
